#+TITLE: Completion candidates

Completion candidates is a library to help you provide completion
candidates in an *extensible* manner. The completion-backend selects
the strategy to find (*candidates-for*) and sort (*score*) the
candidates. Because the results of all applicable methods for
*candidates-for* are collected one can add different search strategies
through mix-ins.

Look at the file example.lisp for an example to complete according to file
names present in *$PATH*
