#+TITLE: Completion Candidate's Manual

* Overview

Completion Candidates is a framework to provide completions. That is
given a pattern it provides alternatives to what that pattern may
refer to. It is inspired by [helm]. However unlike Helm it takes
advantage of CLOS features that are not present in [EIEIO],
method-combinations in particular.

* Usage
** How do I register a action for certain candidates?

The way to inform others that an action is applicable for the
candidate is to define method that specializes on the candidate class
you want. For example if you want to make the action, =open-file=,
available for files you would write:

#+begin_src lisp
  (defmethod action-for append ((candidate file-candidate))
    'open-file)
#+end_src

The symbol must refer to a function that takes a single parameter as a
result, the candidate.
