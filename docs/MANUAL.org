#+TITLE: Completion Candidate's Manual

* Overview

Completion Candidates is a framework to provide completions. That is
given a pattern it provides alternatives to what that pattern may
refer to. It is inspired by [helm]. However unlike Helm it takes
advantage of CLOS features that are not present in [EIEIO],
method-combinations in particular.
